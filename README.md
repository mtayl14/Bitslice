Now, talking with Dr. Stine on Monday, Nov 29th, he said that the two's complement subtraction wasn't actually required.
I was under the impression that it was required, but re-reading the project description, he states that _it would be easy to implement_, not that it's required.

So I implemented it, thinking it was mandatory. Oh well. Hopefully I can get some extra credit for it, I haven't been great on the homework.
